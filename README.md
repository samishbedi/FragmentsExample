# FragmentsExample
A simple application that uses Fragments to produce a two-pane or single-pane user interface depending on the current device’s screen size to display simulated Twitter Tweets.This application will present multiple Fragments arranged in different layouts depending on the device’s screen size. One of these Fragments, called the FriendsFragment, will display the names of several celebrities. If the user selects a name from this Fragment, he or she will see several simulated Twitter Tweets from these people, appearing in a second Fragment, called the FeedFragment.
